# Advanced Learning Algorithms - Machine Learning Specialization âœ…

This repository contains my code and projects from **Course 2 ("Advanced Learning Algorithms")** of DeepLearning.AI's [Machine Learning Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/machine-learning-introduction).

## ðŸ§  Topics Covered âœ…
- **Week 1**: Neural Networks Basics (Forward Propagation, Activation Functions)
- **Week 2**: Training Neural Networks (Backpropagation, TensorFlow Implementation)
- **Week 3**: Multiclass Classification (Softmax, Cross-Entropy, Evaluation Metrics)
- **Week 4**: Decision Trees, Random Forests & XGBoost (using Scikit-learn)

## ðŸ’» Projects âœ…
Each week includes a hands-on lab or mini-project such as:
- Neural Network from Scratch (NumPy-only implementation)
- Image Classifier with Softmax (TensorFlow)
- Decision Tree for Financial Predictions (Scikit-learn)

## ðŸ›  Technologies Used âœ…
- **Python** (NumPy, Matplotlib, Pandas)
- **TensorFlow 2.x** (primary for Weeks 1â€“3)
- **Scikit-learn** (primary for Week 4)
